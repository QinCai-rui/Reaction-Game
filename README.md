# Reaction Game
By QinCai, https://qincai.xyz

## Description
This is a simple (but not so simple) hardware game, where one or two players press a button after a LED turns off. The reaction time is the time between the LED turns off and the user presses the button.

## How to Play
1. Head your browser to https://wokwi.com/projects/406241938731148289 and press the green circle with a triangle inside! The game might be slow, and the timer might not work properly, depending on the device you are using.

2. Read and follow the instructions displayed on the OLED screen.

3. Press your button (or 1 on the keyboard for the Left button, 2 for the Right button) as soon as the LED turns off. No cheating by pressing and holding the button! The program won't allow you to do that muahahaha! ; )

4. Your reaction time will be displayed on the OLED screen. If you are in two-player mode, only the reaction time of the fastest person that presses will be displayed!
